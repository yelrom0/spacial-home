### [Godot Notification Handler](https://github.com/yelrom0/godot-openxr-notification-handler-plugin/tree/main/README.md)

This is the README for the Godot Notification Handler plugin. It is a plugin for the Godot game engine that allows for the handling of notifications from the OpenXR runtime.

I include this plugin as a git subtree in res://godot-openxr-notification-handler-plugin/ so that I can easily include it in this project, and develop it alongside the rest of the project.

NOTE: This next section will eventuall be moved to the README for the plugin itself.

#### Installation

To install the plugin, you can either clone the repository and add the files to your project, or you can add it as a git subtree.

More information about installing Godot Plugins can be found in the [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).
